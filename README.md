This project is based on two significant software projects:

 Si4735 Library developed by Ricardo Caritti: https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735

 FT8 Decoding Library by Karlis Goba: https://github.com/kgoba/ft8_lib

DSP Audio Architecture
Decoding FT8 requires significant data storage and processing speed.

In order to optimize both program storage and processing speed requirements so that the Teensy 3.6 is not over taxed, the Teensy Audio Library has been modified to allow Analog to Digital conversion to be run at the rate of 6400 samples per second. This allows audio data processing to be done at 3200 Hz. The 3200 Hz audio processing with a 2048 FTT to process the received audio for FT8 decoding yields a bin spacing of 3.125 Hz.

The algorithms developed by Karlis Goba use the 3.125 Hz spaced FFT bins to be screened in both frequency and time so that errors in symbol frequency and time reception  can be overcome to provide really great FT8 decoding. The end spacing of the FT8 algorithms is 6.25 Hz.
